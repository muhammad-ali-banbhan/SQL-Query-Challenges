# SQL-Interview-Prep-Queries

Welcome to my SQL interview preparation repository!

This repository is a dedicated space to document my journey of mastering SQL queries for technical interviews. Here, you'll find a growing collection of my solutions to common interview questions, problems from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, and complex scenarios designed to test a range of SQL skills.

The queries are structured to showcase my problem-solving approach, with a focus on:

- **Clarity:** Writing readable and well-commented code.
- **Efficiency:** Exploring multiple ways to solve a problem and discussing performance trade-offs.
- **Fundamental Concepts:** Covering core SQL topics like `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `subqueries`.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Practicing more complex concepts such as `window functions`, `CTE`s, and performance optimization.

Each query file will include a description of the problem and the tables used, followed by the SQL solution. The goal of this repository is not just to provide answers, but to serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding the logic behind the code.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback. This is a living document of my continuous learning and growth.

Happy querying!
