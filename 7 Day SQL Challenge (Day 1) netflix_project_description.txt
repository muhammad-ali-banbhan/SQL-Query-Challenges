Project: Netflix Movies & TV Shows SQL Practice

Dataset Description:
This dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. 
It includes various attributes such as title, type, release year, runtime, IMDb scores, age certification, and more.
We used this dataset to practice SQL queries and perform exploratory data analysis.

Dataset Columns:
1. title - Name of the movie or TV show
2. type - Either 'MOVIE' or 'SHOW'
3. release_year - Year in which the title was released
4. age_certification - Age rating of the content (e.g., PG, R, 18+)
5. runtime_minutes - Duration of the movie/show in minutes
6. imdb_score - IMDb rating (float value)
7. imdb_votes - Number of votes received on IMDb
8. other columns may contain genre, description, etc.

Objective:
Our goal was to practice different SQL skills including filtering, aggregation, grouping, and ordering by 
answering the following questions:

Queries Performed:
1. Find total number of movies and TV shows.
2. Count content per age certification.
3. Calculate average IMDb score by type (movie vs TV show).
4. Identify the most common release year.
5. List top 5 titles with highest IMDb score.
6. Count titles per release year.
7. Find count of movies with runtime over 120 minutes.
8. Calculate average IMDb score by age certification.
9. Count titles released before the year 2000.
10. List titles with IMDb score greater than the overall average.

Outcome:
By completing these 10 queries, we successfully explored and analyzed key aspects of the Netflix dataset 
while strengthening SQL query writing skills.
