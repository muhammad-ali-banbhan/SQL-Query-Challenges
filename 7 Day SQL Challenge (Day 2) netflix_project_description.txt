Project Title: Day 2 - SQL Practice on Netflix Shows & Movies Dataset

Dataset Overview:
This dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
Our goal for Day 2 was to practice intermediate SQL queries using real-world data.

Dataset Size:
- Total rows: X (replace with actual number of rows)
- Total columns: 9

Columns Description:
1. id                → Unique identifier for each title.
2. title             → Name of the movie or TV show.
3. type              → Indicates whether the record is a MOVIE or SHOW.
4. release_year      → Year when the title was released.
5. age_certification → Age rating or certification for the content.
6. runtime_minutes   → Duration of the movie/show in minutes.
7. imdb_id           → Unique IMDb identifier.
8. imdb_score        → IMDb rating score.
9. imdb_votes        → Total number of IMDb votes.

Objective of the Project:
We aimed to perform SQL queries to:
- Filter data based on release year, rating, and content type.
- Find top-rated movies and shows.
- Identify the oldest and newest releases.
- Calculate average ratings and votes.
- Perform aggregate operations like MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT.
- Work with ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and LIMIT clauses.
- Explore percentile-based analysis (adjusted for MySQL).

Outcome:
The project helped strengthen understanding of filtering, sorting, aggregation,
and analytical SQL functions using a real dataset.
